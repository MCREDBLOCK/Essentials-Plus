## About this plugin
**Not to be confused with the Essentials plugin,** this plugin allows you to toggle if someone in the server is streaming or not. When the streaming mode is on, the streamer can send the IP to their viewers and the viewers can join the server and automatically be put in spectator mode. It also allows you to use the /gmc, /gma, /gmsp, /gms gamemode commands.
